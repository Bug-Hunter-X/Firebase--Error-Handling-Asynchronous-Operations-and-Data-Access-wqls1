The Firebase SDK might throw an error if you try to access a property of a document snapshot before the snapshot has fully loaded. This can happen if you use asynchronous operations without proper error handling. For example, if you try to access `snapshot.data().name` before the `getDoc()` promise resolves, you might encounter an error, such as `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'name')`. This is because `snapshot.data()` might still be `undefined` at that point.
